introductory excercise to practice html and css by creating a website homepage

Html: 
 Condensed html to be in clean semantic form. Added the class names "benefits" and " benefits"
 
 Added alt text to images so now the website is inclusive to those with accessibility issues.
 
 Fixed the first broken link in the navigation bar.

Css: 
Condensed the CSS.  There were redundant selectors. 

The css code applies styles to the navigation bar, the hero image, the webdsite content and the copy-write section.
